```sh
mkdir -p ~/Applications && cd ~/Applications

```
```sh
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
```
```sh
CUSTOM_NVIM_PATH=~/Applications/nvim.appimage
# Set the above with the correct path, then run the rest of the commands:
set -u
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ex ex "${CUSTOM_NVIM_PATH}" 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/vi vi "${CUSTOM_NVIM_PATH}" 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/view view "${CUSTOM_NVIM_PATH}" 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/vim vim "${CUSTOM_NVIM_PATH}" 110
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/vimdiff vimdiff "${CUSTOM_NVIM_PATH}" 110
```

### 2. Clone the nvims:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim && cd ~/.config/nvim

```
### 3. Install Packages & Language Support:

#### Open Neovim...
```sh
nvim init.lua
```
